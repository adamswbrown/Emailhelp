# Archive Folder

This folder contains experimental, diagnostic, and unused files that are not part of the main application.

## Structure

### `experimental/`
Contains experimental features and trials that were not integrated into the main application:

- **`test_graph_api.py`** - Microsoft Graph API integration trial
- **`GRAPH_API_SETUP.md`** - Setup documentation for Graph API trial

These files represent an exploration of Microsoft Graph API as an alternative email source, but were not pursued further in favor of the current AppleScript and database-based approaches.

### `diagnostics/`
Contains diagnostic and debugging utilities:

- **`inspect_db.py`** - Inspect Apple Mail Envelope Index database schema
- **`inspect_outlook_db.py`** - Inspect Outlook SQLite database structure
- **`test_outlook.py`** - Test script for Outlook integration
- **`read_email.py`** - Utility to read full email content for debugging

These files are useful for debugging and understanding database structures but are not required for normal operation of the application.

## Usage

If you need these files, they can be moved back to the root directory. They are kept here for reference and potential future use.
